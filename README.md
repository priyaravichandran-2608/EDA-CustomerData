# 🧠 Customer Segmentation EDA for Sales Optimization

Welcome to my data exploration journey! In this project, I dove into customer data to uncover key insights that can help businesses fine-tune their sales strategies and boost performance where it matters most.

## 📊 Project Goal

The aim was simple:  
Understand customer behavior and identify patterns that reveal *who’s buying what, from where, and why*. With those insights, I proposed data-driven strategies that companies can actually use to increase their sales.


## 📌 What I Discovered

After analyzing the data in-depth, here’s what stood out:

Who??
  Married women, aged 26–35.

Where??
  From **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**.

What do they do??
  They work in **Healthcare, IT, and Aviation**.

What are they buying??  
  Mostly **Food**, **Clothing**, and **Electronics**.

This group represents a high-potential customer segment!
